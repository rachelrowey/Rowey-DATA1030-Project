# Rowey-DATA1030-Project
Overview: This project uses the WPBC database in order to predict the recurrence of breast cancer. The dataset contains many cell, tumor, and patient characteristics to be utilized for this classification problem. For this project, EDA was first performed, the code for which can be found in the EDA file in src folder. The figures can be found in the figures folder (figure1-12). Preprocessing, data splitting, and model analysis was performed for four algorithms (logistic regression, random forest, SVC, and XGBoost), all of which can be found in the src folder as well. The optimal logistic regression model, its predictions, and its corresponding figures can be found across the figures, src, and results folders.
